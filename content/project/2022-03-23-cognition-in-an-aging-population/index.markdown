I am using 2018 Core data from the Health and Retirement Study. The data was gathered by the University of Michigan from Apr 2018 - Jun 2019. The Human and Retirement Study first began in 1990 in order to answer questions about the aging population. Since then, new cohorts have been added every year, creating a large database of over 20,000 participants encompassing longitudinal and cross-sectional data.
