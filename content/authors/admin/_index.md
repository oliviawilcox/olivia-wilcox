I am a current graduate student at Case Western Reserve University in the Population and Quantitative Health Sciences Department finishing my MS in Clinical Research. Through my graduate studies, I've discovered a love for working with data and effectively communicating scientific findings. I am interested in starting a career in data science and data analytics.
